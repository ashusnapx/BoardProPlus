# Typings.d.ts

The `typings.d.ts` file in your Next.js project contains type definitions for the data structures used in your application. These definitions ensure that your code follows a specific structure and help prevent errors by providing static typing.

## Board Interface
The `Board` interface represents a board consisting of columns. It has a `columns` property, which is a `Map` containing keys of type `TypedColumn` and values of type `Column`. This interface describes the structure and properties of the board.

## TypedColumn Type
The `TypedColumn` type is a union type that can have one of three string values: `"todo"`, `"in-progress"`, or `"done"`. This type is used as the key in the `columns` map of the `Board` interface to differentiate between different column types.

## Column Interface
The `Column` interface represents a column on the board. It has an `id` property of type `TypedColumn`, which specifies the type of the column. The `todos` property is an array of `Todo` objects, representing the tasks associated with the column.

## Todo Interface
The `Todo` interface represents a task in the board. It has several properties:
- `$id`: A string property representing a unique identifier for the task.
- `$createdAt`: A string property indicating the creation date of the task.
- `title`: A string property storing the title or name of the task.
- `status`: A property of type `TypedColumn` indicating the current status of the task.
- `image` (optional): An optional property of type `Image` representing an associated image for the task.

## Image Interface
The `Image` interface represents an image associated with a task. It has two properties:
- `bucketId`: A string property representing the identifier of the image bucket in a storage system.
- `fileId`: A string property representing the identifier of the image file within the bucket.

Please ensure that these types and interfaces are imported or declared wherever they are used in your Next.js project to ensure type safety and improve code quality.

Note: This explanation assumes basic familiarity with TypeScript and its type syntax. If you have any specific questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!
